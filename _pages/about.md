I am an immigrant who is passionate about understanding and telling other immigrants' stories in Canada. Sometimes, these stories involve numbers, sometimes words, and sometimes silence. By studying immigration, I am trying to make sense of my own story and the story of my family.

My research is in the intersection of immigration, information and, the state. Just like every other thing in life, immigration is both social and political; both individual and collective; and both personal and governmental. Information shapes what we think, how we behave and more importantly, who we are. In a context of global migration where identities become more and more fluid, it is the information we receive that determines the way we make sense of a new society and how we position ourselves within that society. This brings me to the final component: where to put the state between information and immigration, between technology and immigrant?

My research is a story about understanding this triangle of of three aspects of immigration: individual, governmental, and informational. To better understand this complexity, I study immigration by combining theories and methodologies from public administration and information science.

I hold a Master of Arts degree from the Department of History and a Master of Science degree from the School of Information Studies at McGill University, Montréal, QC.

I am a PhD Candidate at École nationale d'administration publique and my doctoral project is supervised by Prof. Tatiana Garakani. I work as Policy Analyst at the Government of Canada and as Researcher at École nationale d'administration publique as part of the [REGARDS](https://regardsrecherche.com/) research team.

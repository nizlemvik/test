I am a Turkish Canadian with an immigrant backgorund. I am passionate about understanding and telling other immigrants' stories in Canada. Sometimes, these stories involve numbers, sometimes words, and sometimes silence. My research is empirical in nature, and aims to capture this complexity by collecting data on people.

The focus of my research is in the intersection of immigration, information and, the state. Just like every other thing in life, immigration is both social and political; both individual and collective; and both personal and governmental. Information shapes what we think, how we behave and more importantly, who we are. In a context of global migration where identities become more and more fluid, it is the information we receive that determines the way we make sense of a new society and we position ourselves within that society. This brings me to the final component: where to put the state between information and immigration, between technology and immigrant?

My research is about understanding this triangle of the three aspects of immigration: individual, governmental, and informational. To reflect this complexity, I study immigration by combining theories and methodologies from public administration and information science.

I am a PhD Candidate at [École nationale d'administration publique](https://enap.ca/enap/fr/accueil.aspx) and my doctoral project is supervised by Prof. Tatiana Garakani. I work as a Policy Analyst at the Government of Canada and as a Researcher at École nationale d'administration publique as part of the [REGARDS](https://regardsrecherche.com/) research team.
